# Self-Improvement

Activate when: user corrects a mistake, or says "merk dir das", "remember this", "lesson learned", "das merken", "never do that again".

## After Every Correction

- Capture the pattern in `.claude/memory.md` — what went wrong and what the fix looks like
- Write a rule for yourself that prevents the same mistake next time
- Don't just note the correction — extract the general principle behind it

## At Session Start

- Review `.claude/memory.md` for patterns relevant to the current project
- Apply learned lessons before they become repeat mistakes

## Iterate

- If the same type of mistake happens twice, the lesson wasn't specific enough — rewrite it
- Ruthlessly prune lessons that no longer apply
