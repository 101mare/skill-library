| [docker-builder](../skills/build/backend/docker-builder/SKILL.md) | Scaffolds Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for Python projects. Covers multi-stage builds, health checks, env vars, network isolation, and GPU setup. |
| [exception-builder](../skills/build/backend/exception-builder/SKILL.md) | Designs Python exception hierarchies for layered applications. Covers base exceptions, layer mapping, chaining, and handler patterns. |
| [logging-builder](../skills/build/backend/logging-builder/SKILL.md) | Implements Python logging infrastructure following best practices. Creates logger configurations, adds logging to functions, sets up file rotation. |
| [project-scaffold](../skills/build/backend/project-scaffold/SKILL.md) | Scaffolds production-ready Python project structure: directory layout, pyproject.toml, config, logging, exceptions, testing, and CI/CD basics. |
| [prompt-builder](../skills/build/backend/prompt-builder/SKILL.md) | Transforms unstructured user requests into optimized, structured prompts. Systematically asks clarifying questions about goals, context, constraints, and output format. Suggests improvements before generating the final prompt. Adapts language to match user's input language automatically. |

### Build — Frontend (2)

| Name | Description |
|------|------------|
| [frontend-design](../skills/build/frontend/frontend-design/SKILL.md) | Creates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics. |
| [warmgold-frontend](../skills/build/frontend/warmgold-frontend/SKILL.md) | Design system and component patterns for warm, iOS-inspired vanilla frontends. |

### Workflow (7)

| Name | Description |
|------|------------|
| [deep-research](../skills/workflow/deep-research/SKILL.md) | Structured research workflow: Question → Sources (web + codebase) → Analyze → Synthesize → Document. |
| [plan-review](../skills/workflow/plan-review/SKILL.md) | Reviews implementation plans before coding begins. Checks completeness, architecture fit, risks, and requirement alignment. Uses specialized agents in parallel for thorough analysis. Proactively asks clarifying questions when uncertainties are found. |
| [pr-review](../skills/workflow/pr-review/SKILL.md) | Orchestrates pull request reviews using specialized agents in parallel. Reads PR diff, selects relevant reviewers, aggregates findings. |
| [ralph-loop](../skills/workflow/ralph-loop/SKILL.md) | Start an autonomous work loop. Claude keeps working on the given task until it signals completion or the iteration limit is reached. |
| [ralph-loop-prompt-builder](../skills/workflow/ralph-loop-prompt-builder/SKILL.md) | Builds effective prompts for the Ralph Loop autonomous work system. Asks clarifying questions about the task, then generates a structured prompt with clear requirements, verification steps, and completion criteria. |
| [session-verify](../skills/workflow/session-verify/SKILL.md) | End-of-session verification skill that validates all changes made during a coding session. Checks for bugs, security vulnerabilities, dead code, efficiency issues, and documentation gaps. |
| [tdd](../skills/workflow/tdd/SKILL.md) | Test-Driven Development workflow: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. Orchestrates test-architect (write failing test) → implementation → code-simplifier (refactor). Ensures tests define behavior BEFORE code exists — not after. |

### Patterns (8)

| Name | Description |
|------|------------|
