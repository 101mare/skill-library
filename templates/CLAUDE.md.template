# [Project Name]

[What this project does in 1-2 sentences. Be specific — not "a web app" but "REST API for invoice processing with PDF extraction and tax calculation."]

## Critical Constraints

<!-- U-shaped attention: Claude weighs the beginning and end most heavily.
     Put project-specific non-negotiable rules here.
     Generic rules (DRY, security, agent behavior) are covered by ~/.claude/rules/ -->

1. **[Project-specific constraint, e.g.: "Never import provider-specific types in services/"]**
2. **[Another constraint, e.g.: "All processing must stay 100% local, no external API calls"]**
3. **[Add more as needed]**

## Architecture

<!-- Keep this brief. Link to detailed docs if they exist. -->

```
[High-level data flow, e.g.:]
Input -> Ingestion -> Processing -> Validation -> Output
```

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `src/[package]/services/` | Business logic |
| `src/[package]/adapters/` | External integrations |
| `src/[package]/config/` | Pydantic config models |
| `src/[package]/models/` | Domain models, DTOs |

<!-- Add: interfaces, key design patterns (DI, Strategy, etc.) -->

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Run
python -m [package]

# Test
pytest -q --tb=line

# Lint + Format
ruff check . --fix && ruff format .
```

## Project-Specific Patterns

<!-- Document patterns unique to THIS project. Generic patterns (DRY, error handling,
     testing) are in ~/.claude/rules/ and don't need to be repeated here. -->

### Import Conventions

```python
# [Example of this project's import style]
from [package].services.foo import FooService
from [package].interfaces.bar import BarProtocol

# Within a package: relative imports
from .utils import helper
```

### [Key Pattern, e.g.: Provider Pattern]

<!-- Document how the main design pattern works in this project -->

### [Key Pattern, e.g.: Exception Hierarchy]

<!-- Document project-specific exceptions and when to use them -->

## Configuration

<!-- How config works in this project: YAML structure, env-var overrides, Pydantic models -->

```yaml
# config.yaml — key sections
[example config structure]
```

## Quick Reference

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Config | `config.yaml` |
| Config Models | `src/[package]/config/models.py` |
| Entry Point | `src/[package]/cli.py` |
| Tests | `tests/` |
| Logs | `logs/` |
| [Key domain file] | `src/[package]/...` |
